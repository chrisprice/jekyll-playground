<div class="entry"><p>I’ve been working on a Windows Store application called EdBus, as part of the CodeProject <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/script/Awards/competition.aspx?cid=598">AppInnovation contest</a>.  It’s not yet finished, but I’ve written <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/478497/EdBus-Public-Transport-Locator-app">an article</a> about it as part of the competition.  EdBus presents nearby bus stops, with details about services and bus times, so you can easily see which bus stop to walk to to catch the bus you want.</p><p><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/478497/EdBus-Public-Transport-Locator-app"><img src="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/niddrie.png" alt="The EdBus main screen" title="EdBus main screen" width="640" height="360" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161554" /></a></p></div>
