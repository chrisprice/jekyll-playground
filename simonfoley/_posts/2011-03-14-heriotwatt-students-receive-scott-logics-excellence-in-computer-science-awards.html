Scott Logic’s Head of Development for Scotland, Simon Foley, joined Phil Trinder, Professor in Computer Science in the School of Mathematics and Computer Science, for the ceremony. The awards recognise the top five penultimate year undergraduates on the Masters programme based on academic performance.</p><p>The winning student, Pierre-Andre Saulais, received a framed certificate and £200 with four  runners-up (William Reilly, Joseph Davidson, Thies Gehrmann, Christopher Wylie) each winning £100. Thies received his prize in absentia. Two of the winning students also attended an interview for the chance to undertake a 6 month work placement at Scott Logic in 2011.</p><p>During the reception, Phil thanked Scott Logic for the ongoing support provided to the Masters course and emphasised the importance that Heriot-Watt places on building business relationships. Simon Foley commented “It was great to meet Phil and the award winners at the Edinburgh campus. Developing our links with Heriot-Watt and the rest of the Scottish academic community is crucial to our growth as a Scottish business.”</p></div>
