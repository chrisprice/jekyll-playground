<div class="entry"><p>Scott Logic is proud to announce that we are to sponsor <strong>TechMeetup</strong>, a community for software developers based in Scotland. From its website:<br />
<em><br />
“TechMeetup is a monthly excuse for developers and the tech community around Scotland to eat pizza, drink beer (or juice!) and learn new stuff from each other. No name badges, no sales pitches, just informative presentations from your peers and a chance to meet some of the tech community around you.”</em></p><p>Details at <a href="http://www.techmeetup.co.uk" target="_blank">TechMeetup</a>. Come along and get involved!</p></div>
