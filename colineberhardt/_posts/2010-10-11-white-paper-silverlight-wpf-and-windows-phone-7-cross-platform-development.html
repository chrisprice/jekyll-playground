To accompany the talk I wrote a white paper which delves into this subject in a little more detail.</p><p>You can download the whitepaper here: <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/colin/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/WPF-and-Silverlight-Unification.pdf">WPF and Silverlight Cross Platform Development White Paper</a> (PDF, 1.8 MBytes)</p><p>Or view it online in the PDF viewer below: </p><p><iframe src="http://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scottlogic.co.uk%2Fblog%2Fcolin%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2010%2F10%2FWPF-and-Silverlight-Unification.pdf&amp;embedded=true" width="600" height="780" style="border: none;"></iframe></p><p>I also created a cross platform application that has a 75% shared codebase between the WPF (desktop), Silverlight (web) and Windows Phone 7 (mobile) versions. I plan to share more of this at a later date.</p><p>Any thoughts, ideas or comments, please share them below.</p><p>Regards,<br />
