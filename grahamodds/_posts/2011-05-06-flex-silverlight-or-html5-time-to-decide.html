Recent advances in web technologies have resulted in a complex landscape for application<br />
developers to navigate. Coupled with the recent boom in new platforms, from desktops, netbooks,<br />
smartphones to tablets, making an informed and future proof technology choice is all the more<br />
difficult. In this paper we will set technology bias and politics aside to navigate the similarities and<br />
differences between Flex, Silverlight and HTML5 and give you the power to decide.</em></p>
<p>This white-paper is aimed at technical decision makers who are looking to choose the correct<br />
technology for web application development.<br />
