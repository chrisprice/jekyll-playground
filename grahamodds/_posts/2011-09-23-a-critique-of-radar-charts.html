The values for adjacent variables in a single series are connected by lines, and, frequently, the polygonal shape created by these lines in filled with a colour.  Beyond this there are many subtle variations that have different consequences with respect to the efficacy of the chart.  These variations will be covered at appropriate points in the following critique.</p><p><a name="chart1"></a><img src="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/graham/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Spider_Chart_wikipedia.jpg" alt="Radar Chart from Wikipedia" title="Radar Chart from Wikipedia" width="538" height="295" class="aligncenter" /></p><p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 180px;">Chart 1: Radar chart from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Spider_Chart.jpg" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p><h2 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Critique</h2><h4>Axes and Values</h4><p>The axes of radar charts represent independent scales for each of the quantitative variables under consideration.  Therefore, barring <a href="#occlusion">occlusion</a>, comparing values for a single variable between series is straightforward and relatively effortless since it merely consists of assessing their position along a line, something we are able to do without any thought.  However, a number of distinct issues arise when attempting to compare values across different axes.</p><p>Firstly (and most easily grasped), by definition there is nothing prohibiting axes representing wildly different scales since they are nominally independent.  This is shown at its extreme in <a href="#chart2">Chart 2</a>.  Clearly comparison across variables is pointless in this case, yet it is something a radar chart is designed to encourage us to do.  Hopefully from this extreme example you are also able to appreciate that even in subtler cases where the scales are genuinely independent, whether that be the inversion of the scale on one axis or slightly different ranges of values being represented, comparison is rather absurd.  So much so that very few charting libraries or applications support this in any way.</p><p><a name="chart2"></a><img src="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/graham/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/few.png" alt="Radar Chart by Stephen Few" title="Radar Chart by Stephen Few" width="428" height="288" class="aligncenter" /></p><p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 130px;">Chart 2: <a href="www.perceptualedge.com/articles/dmreview/radar_graphs.pdf" target="_blank">Artificial radar chart by Stephen Few to show independent axis scales</a></p><p>Unfortunately, even with a common scale between axes, comparing values across them remains cumbersome and error-prone.  This is because rather than the simple straight-line comparison our visual perception is hard-wired to perform that is found in “conventional” chart types, comparison in radar charts requires conscious thought to mentally project a sort of arc of rotation to map a value from one axis onto another, something we are not particularly adept at.</p><p><a name="chart3"></a><img src="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/graham/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/radar_chart_visiblox.png" alt="Radar Chart by Visiblox" title="Radar Chart by Visiblox" width="531" height="336" class="aligncenter" /></p><p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 250px;">Chart 3: Radar chart by<a href="http://www.visiblox.com/examples/RadarChart" target="_blank">Visiblox</a></p><p>In order to help general perception and, in particular, comparison across axes, radar charts usually display gridlines connecting axes when they share a common scale (giving them their traditional spider-web-like appearance).  However, even with these gridlines it remains cumbersome to compare values on non-adjacent axes.  For example, try comparing the Space and Comfort scores for Monster Truck in <a href="chart3">Chart 3</a>.  It requires a surprising amount of conscious effort, doesn’t it?</p><p><a name="chart4"></a><a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/graham/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/radar_chart_kaplab.png"><img src="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/graham/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/radar_chart_kaplab.png" alt="Radar Chart by Kap Lab" title="Radar Chart by Kap Lab" width="537" height="432" class="aligncenter" /></a></p><p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 260px;">Chart 4: Radar chart by <a href="http://lab.kapit.fr/display/radarchart/Radar+Chart" target="_blank">Kap Lab</a></p><p>Aside from the <a href="http://www.infovis-wiki.net/index.php/Data-Ink_Ratio" target="_blank">non-data ink</a> gridlines inevitably add, they also introduce further issues to radar charts.  Mainly, they tend to add confusion around axis value labelling by breaking the association by proximity used to associate a particular value label with a mark on an axis.  This is very clearly demonstrated in <a href="#chart1">Chart 1</a>.  It requires active thought to disassociate the labels from the gridlines over which they inadvertently lie.  For example, what is actually the $60 gridline appears to be labelled $50 instead.  <a href="chart3">Chart 3</a> demonstrates a commonly attempted solution to this problem that unfortunately makes the chart just as difficult to read, only in a different way.  Here the labels are so far away from the axis that, once again, conscious effort is required to comprehend what should be an inconspicuous, almost sub-conscious interpretation aide for the chart.</p><p><a name="chart5"></a><a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/graham/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/radar_chart_dundas.png"><img src="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/graham/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/radar_chart_dundas.png" alt="Radar Chart by Dundas Data Visualisation" title="Radar Chart by Dundas Data Visualisation" width="417" height="336" class="aligncenter" /></a></p><p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 215px;">Chart 5: Radar chart by <a href="http://support2.dundas.com/OnlineDocumentation/winchart2005/RadarChart.html" target="_blank">Dundas Data Visualisation</a></p><p><em>Occasionally the gridlines on a radar chart are presented as circles rather than straight connecting lines between equivalent values on adjacent axes, as in <a href="#chart5">Chart 5</a>.  Conceptually, I do not understand how a chart can combine circular connections between axis values and straight line connections between series values.  Surely they must adhere to the same notional underlying data space?!  Otherwise the chart is fundamentally broken.  If anyone feels like creating a radar chart using strictly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system" target="_blank">polar data space</a> for both gridlines and series shapes, could you please send me a link?  I’ve never actually seen one, and always like a giggle…</em></p><h4><a name="lines"></a>Connecting Lines and Nominal Scales</h4><p>The quantitative variables and their values represented on the various axes of a radar chart are, with the exception of some less common cases such as when plotting timeseries data, distinct and unrelated.  Yet, by design, radar charts force the suggestion of some relationship between the variables by having a connecting line between values on different axis in order to create the series grouping, thereby misleading the user.  To help clarify this point, the chart below is identical to <a href="chart5">Chart 5</a> except that the information is plotted using “conventional” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system" target="_blank">cartesian coordinates</a> rather than the (pseudo-)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system" target="_blank">polar coordinates</a> of a radar chart.</p><p><a name="chart6"></a><img src="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/graham/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/line_chart_dundas.png" alt="Line Chart of Radar Chart by Dundas Data Visualisation" title="Line Chart of Radar Chart by Dundas Data Visualisation" width="586" height="263" class="aligncenter" /></p><p>In this more familiar, non-circular format it is hopefully much more obvious that we are in fact dealing with a nominal scale on the x axis.  That is, the categories on the x axis are simply named entities that have no intrinsic order and do not represent quantitative values.  As such, the relationship and incline or decline in value the connecting line implies is grossly misleading since we could arbitrarily change the relationships by rearranging the categories (something we are free to do because of their lack of intrinsic ordering).  When shown this way, many of you will recognise that this kind of information is likely to be best presented as a bar chart in some form, depending on the specific purpose of the chart, as shown for <a href="href" chart5="chart5">Chart 5</a> below.</p><p><a name="chart7"></a><a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/graham/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/bar_chart_dundas.png"><img src="http://www.scottlogic.co.uk/blog/graham/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/bar_chart_dundas.png" alt="Bar Chart of Radar Chart (Dundas)" title="Bar Chart of Radar Chart (Dundas)" width="573" height="300" class="aligncenter" /></a></p><h4><a name="occlusion"></a>Occlusion</h4><p>Occlusion, in data visualisation, refers to the phenomenon where a part of the visualisation obscures another part.  Clearly this should be avoided, or at least minimised, since hidden visuals prevents you from interpreting the information correctly.  Unfortunately, the design of radar charts means significant occlusion is inevitable when multiple series are plotted, since they must be “on top” of each other.  In cases where the fill colour of the shape of a series is relatively or completely opaque, such as <a href="chart5">Chart 5</a>, it can be nigh on impossible to see particular values.  In these cases, the gridlines are also at best partially obscured, thereby making it even more cumbersome to discern the value any any given point.  In <a href="#chart5">Chart 5</a> this is has been somewhat overcome by adding tick marks on top of the series, which, unfortunately, also adds to the overall clutter on the chart.</p><p>When transparency is used to circumvent the problems caused by solid fill colours it creates a new problem: the unavoidable tinting effect can make differentiating the underlying series or matching them to a legend very difficult.  As such, the approach that suffers least from occlusion is when no fill colour is used, as in <a href="#chart1">Chart 1</a>.</p><h4>Shapes</h4><p>One argument given by proponents of radar charts is that we are naturally adept at seeing and evaluating simple shapes.  Although this is true, it overlooks the major issue that the overall shape presented for a series on a radar chart does not leverage any of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-attentive_processing" target="_blank">pre-attentive attributes</a> we perceive quantitatively.  In essence, this means we are unable to attribute much genuine meaning to the shape of a series.  The only patterns our visual perception can really discern in a data set presented as a radar chart are similarity and extreme outliers.  Both patterns are just as easy, if not easier, to recognise in more effective <a href="#alternatives">alternative visualisations</a>, such as line and bar charts, where the shapes also have quantitative perception.  Consider the example radar charts above, can you reliably say anything useful about the respective series based on their shapes other than where they are similar or there is an outlier?</p><p>A further issue with the shapes presented by radar charts are that the area of the shapes increases as a square of the values rather than linearly.  This can cause us to misinterpret the data since a small difference in values results in a significant difference in area, thereby exaggerating any difference when we follow our natural inclination to compare the size of the shapes.</p><h2><a name="alternatives"></a>Alternatives</h2></div>
